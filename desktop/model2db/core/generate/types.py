"""What every output is made of. Mirrors web/src/core/generate/types.ts.

A writer is an object with `id`, `label`, `group`, optionally `engines` (SQL engines the user can choose) and
`migrations` (whether it can add a migration), and `write(physical, context)`, which returns the files as
dictionaries with `name`, `content` and `editorLanguage`. The context holds `schema`, `design`, `settings`,
`title` and `note(note)`."""
